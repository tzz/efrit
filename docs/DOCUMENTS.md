# Documents from outside Emacs: Google Drive, Google Calendar, Confluence

efrit can read documents that live in other systems and bring them
into an analysis: the Google Doc a meeting recap links to, the notes
Calendar took for that meeting, the Confluence page with the design.
This document explains what the pieces are, how to set each one up,
and where the Google side needs to be switched on.

## What you get

With at least one source configured:

- `doc_fetch`, `doc_search` and `doc_sources` are tools the model can
  call in any conversation. `doc_search` finds documents by words and
  dates across every configured source; `doc_fetch` returns the text of
  one by URL or reference.
- In Gnus, `efrit-gnus` follows the document links in an article and
  puts the documents' text after the article in everything the model
  reads, then adds *related* documents: the ones a source finds by the
  subject's words near the article's date, and the ones the Calendar
  provider finds on the matching event.
- `gnus-treat-related-documents` (off by default) writes those related
  documents as a footnote into the article you read, with URLs, so you
  can follow them by hand; an analysis of that article reads the
  footnote back instead of searching again. `W R` in a summary applies
  it to any article.

Everything is read-only. Nothing here writes to Drive, Calendar or
Confluence.

## The pieces

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `efrit-auth.el` | Credentials from auth-source, OAuth2 through oauth2.el, authenticated HTTP. |
| `efrit-documents.el` | The source protocol, the session cache, related-document lookup, the `doc_*` tools. |
| `efrit-documents-gdrive.el` | Google Drive: Docs, Sheets, Slides, text files. Fetch and search. |
| `efrit-documents-gcalendar.el` | Google Calendar: not a source but a *provider* of related documents (an event's attachments). |
| `efrit-documents-confluence.el` | Confluence pages and blog posts, Atlassian Cloud and self-hosted. |

`efrit-documents-sources-libraries` lists the libraries loaded when the
tools are registered (`efrit-documents-ensure-tools`, which the Gnus
commands run). Remove a library you do not use, or add your own.

## Credentials: one rule

Every source looks its credentials up in auth-source (`~/.authinfo.gpg`
or whatever `auth-sources` says) by a *host* name. The entry decides how
to authenticate:

- An entry with `client-id`, `client-secret`, `auth-url` and
  `token-url` is an OAuth2 client. efrit-auth runs the consent flow
  through oauth2.el (`oauth2-auth-and-store`), so the token is stored
  in the same plstore, refreshed the same way, and — when
  `oauth2-loopback` is loaded — the authorization code is caught on
  localhost as for Gnus and nngmail. The stored token is keyed by
  auth-url, token-url, scope, client-id and user, so an entry whose
  scope grows gets one new consent and is then cached.
- An entry with only `login` and `password` is a token: sent as
  `Authorization: Bearer PASSWORD`. Add `auth-type basic` to send
  HTTP Basic (`login:password`) instead, which Atlassian Cloud API
  tokens want.

Lookups run with auth-source's cache off and the xoauth2 plugin's
advice disabled for the call, so a negative cache entry or the plugin's
own token dance cannot get in the way.

Two commands help: `M-x efrit-auth-check HOST` says what the entry
looks like and whether a token can be obtained; `M-x
efrit-auth-reauthorize HOST` forgets the token in memory and runs the
consent flow again, which is what you do after adding a scope.

## Google: Drive and Calendar

### One entry, several scopes

The simplest setup is one Google OAuth client and one auth-source
entry whose `scope` lists everything you want, space-separated:

```
machine gmail login you@example.com
  client-id 1234-abcd.apps.googleusercontent.com
  client-secret GOCSPX-...
  auth-url https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth
  token-url https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token
  redirect-uri http://localhost:8999
  scope "https://mail.google.com/ https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events.readonly"
```

Drive is found through the host `gdrive` if such an entry exists, else
through the first of `efrit-documents-gdrive-auth-hosts` (`gmail`,
`gmail.com`, `imap.gmail.com`) whose scope contains a Drive scope.
Calendar does the same with host `gcalendar` and a Calendar scope
(`efrit-documents-gcalendar-auth-hosts` also tries `gdrive` first). So
if you already have a Gmail entry for nngmail or the xoauth2 plugin,
you add the two scopes to it and re-consent once; no second client, no
second entry.

If you prefer separate entries (a client that only ever sees Drive, or
a different account), name them `gdrive` and `gcalendar` and give each
its own scope.

The scopes:

| For | Scope | Why this one |
|---|---|---|
| Drive fetch and search | `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly` | Reads any file the account can open, no writes. `drive.file` would only see files the app itself created, which is none of them. |
| Calendar events | `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events.readonly` | Reads events and their attachments. `calendar.readonly` also works and additionally lists calendars. |

### Where to enable the APIs in the Google Cloud console

A Google OAuth client belongs to a Cloud project, and the project must
have each API *enabled* before a token for it works; otherwise the
first request fails with `403 ... API has not been used in project ...
before or it is disabled` and a link. Do this once per project, in the
project that owns your client id:

1. Open https://console.cloud.google.com/ and pick the project (the
   project selector is at the top; the client id's prefix, the number
   before the dash, is the project number).
2. **APIs & Services → Library** (direct: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library).
   Search for and enable, one at a time:
   - **Google Drive API** (https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/drive.googleapis.com)
   - **Google Calendar API** (https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/calendar-json.googleapis.com)
   - Gmail API is already enabled if nngmail works.
3. **APIs & Services → OAuth consent screen** (in newer consoles:
   **Google Auth Platform → Data Access**,
   https://console.cloud.google.com/auth/scopes). Add the two scopes
   above to the app's scopes. For an app in *Testing* status with only
   you as a test user this is what makes the consent screen offer them;
   for an *Internal* app in a Workspace domain it is the same page.
   Non-sensitive scopes need no verification; `drive.readonly` is
   listed as *restricted* and `calendar.events.readonly` as
   *sensitive*, but neither needs Google's review while the app is
   Internal or in Testing.
4. Nothing changes on the **Credentials** page: the same OAuth client
   id and secret serve all three APIs. The redirect URI
   (`http://localhost:8999`) stays as it was.
5. **Workspace accounts only.** Your administrator may gate which
   third-party apps can use which scopes (Admin console → Security →
   Access and data control → API controls → App access control). If
   Drive or Calendar returns 403 with `access_denied` or
   `admin_policy_enforced` even though the project has the API enabled
   and you consented, that gate is closed for your client id; the admin
   has to mark the app *Trusted* or allow those scopes.

Then, in Emacs: edit the `scope` of the entry, and run `M-x
efrit-auth-reauthorize gmail` (or `M-x nngmail-reauthorize gmail`, same
effect). A browser tab asks you to consent to the new scopes. After
that:

- `M-x efrit-documents-gdrive-check` calls Drive's `about` endpoint and
  reports which auth-source host it used and as whom.
- `M-x efrit-documents-gcalendar-check` lists the calendars the token
  can read.

Both are on the efrit menu (`M-x efrit-menu`: `g` and `k`).

### What Drive does

Fetch: a metadata call (title, modified time; this drives the session
cache, so an unchanged document is never exported twice), then Drive's
export endpoint: Docs as Markdown for the model, as HTML for a renderer
(Gnus washing), Sheets as CSV, Slides as text; plain files are
downloaded as they are. Text is capped at `efrit-documents-max-chars`
(40k).

Search: `files.list` with a `q=` built from the words and dates:
`name contains` for title words (any of them; results are then ranked
by how many they share, so "Notes - The Overclockers" is found for a
recap titled "Recap Bot: 2026-09-21 - The Overclockers"), `fullText
contains` for body words, a `modifiedTime` *or* `createdTime` window,
Google document types and text files only, across shared drives too.

Recognised URLs: `docs.google.com/document|spreadsheets|presentation/d/ID`,
`drive.google.com/file/d/ID`, `drive.google.com/open?id=ID`.

### What Calendar does, and why it exists

Calendar's "take meeting notes" creates a Doc and attaches it to the
event. The recap e-mail for the meeting does not link that Doc, and
searching Drive for the recap's subject finds it only while the Doc and
the meeting still share a name. Meetings get renamed; the notes keep
the old title, or the other way round.

So `efrit-documents-gcalendar` goes by the event instead. Given an item
with a title and a date (the article's Subject and Date, plus From, To
and Cc), it lists the events on `efrit-documents-gcalendar-calendars`
(default `("primary")`) within `efrit-documents-related-days` (3) either
side of the date, recurring events expanded to instances, and drops
events without attachments. Each remaining event is scored: one point
per word the event's title shares with the item's title (after
stopwords), two points if the event's organizer or an attendee address
appears in the item's From/To/Cc, one point for the same day. Events
scoring at least `efrit-documents-gcalendar-min-score` (2) count; the
best `efrit-documents-gcalendar-max-events` (2) give their attachments,
which are returned as Drive documents by file id and fetched like any
other. The title search over Drive still runs afterwards, for documents
that were never attached.

To cover a shared team calendar as well, add its id to
`efrit-documents-gcalendar-calendars` (Calendar settings → the
calendar → *Integrate calendar* → Calendar ID).

## Confluence

One source per site, from `efrit-documents-confluence-sites`:

```elisp
(setq efrit-documents-confluence-sites
      '(("https://example.atlassian.net/wiki" . "example.atlassian.net")   ; Atlassian Cloud: keep /wiki
        ("https://wiki.example.com" "wiki.example.com" "intranet")))       ; self-hosted, given a name
```

Each entry is the web root and the auth-source host; an optional third
element names the source (default `confluence`, `confluence-2`, ...).

Credentials:

- **Atlassian Cloud**: an API token from
  https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens, sent as
  HTTP Basic with your e-mail. The entry needs `auth-type basic`:
  ```
  machine example.atlassian.net login you@example.com password ATATT3x... auth-type basic
  ```
  No admin step is needed for reading with your own account; the token
  has your permissions.
- **Server / Data Center 7.9 and later**: a personal access token
  (profile picture → Settings → Personal Access Tokens), sent as Bearer,
  which is the default for a plain entry:
  ```
  machine wiki.example.com login you password NjE2...
  ```
  A server without PATs takes your password with `auth-type basic`.
- An OAuth2 entry works too (Atlassian 3LO), but is more setup for the
  same access.

What it does: fetch `content/ID` with `body.storage` (Confluence's
XHTML) and the version; the XHTML is rendered to text with shr for the
model (code-block macros keep their content), or handed over as HTML
for a renderer. Search is CQL: `title ~` / `text ~` words within
`lastmodified` bounds, pages and blog posts, newest first. URLs
recognised: `/spaces/KEY/pages/ID/...`, `viewpage.action?pageId=ID`,
`/display/KEY/Title` (one title lookup), `/x/TINY` (one authenticated
HEAD to follow the redirect).

`M-x efrit-documents-confluence-check` (menu `w`) calls `/user/current`
on each site and says who you are, or why not.

## Gnus

`efrit-gnus` uses the layer in three places:

- **Links in an article.** Every URL in the body that a source claims is
  fetched and appended as `--- Linked document: URL ---` followed by the
  text, up to `efrit-gnus-expand-links-max` (5) per article. Backends
  may add expanders for other links through
  `efrit-gnus-expand-link-functions`; nngmail withdraws its own Google
  Docs expander when the Drive source is present.
- **Related documents.** With `efrit-gnus-related-documents` (default
  t) each article also carries `--- Related document (SOURCE): URL ---`
  blocks: the Calendar provider's attachments first, then what the
  sources find by subject words near the Date. This costs one search
  per source per article; set it to nil for large analyses of
  unrelated mail.
- **The footnote.** `gnus-treat-related-documents` is a washing
  treatment like `gnus-treat-buttonize`. It takes the usual values
  (nil, t, a list of group regexps, ...); default nil. Where it is on,
  the article ends with

  ```
  Related documents:
  - Notes: Widget bringup prep (gdrive, 2026-09-15) https://docs.google.com/document/d/.../edit
  ```

  with the URLs buttonized. When you then ask efrit about the displayed
  article, the footnote is read back from the article buffer: its
  documents are fetched as links and no search runs. `W R` applies it by
  hand.

A reasonable configuration for a label of meeting recaps:

```elisp
(with-eval-after-load 'efrit-gnus
  (setq gnus-treat-related-documents '("recaps")))
```

## Debugging

Set `efrit-log-level` to `debug` (`M-x efrit-log-toggle-debug`, or `G`
on the efrit menu) and open the log (`M-x efrit-log-show`). A related-
documents lookup writes one line per step:

```
documents: related for title="Recap Bot: 2026-09-21 - The Overclockers" -> words=("overclockers") date=... linked=(("gdrive" . "1Czw...")) providers=(efrit-documents-gcalendar-related) sources=("gdrive")
documents: gcalendar primary 2026-09-18T16:00:00Z..2026-09-24T16:00:00Z -> 14 events, 3 with attachments
documents: gcalendar event "The Overclockers" at 2026-09-21T14:00:00Z: score 4 (min 2), 1 attachment(s)
documents: provider gcalendar -> 1: "Notes - The Overclockers"
documents: gdrive q=trashed = false and (name contains 'overclockers') and ((modifiedTime >= ...) or (createdTime >= ...)) and (...)
documents: gdrive search title=("overclockers") ... -> 1: "Notes - The Overclockers"
documents: related result 1: gdrive:N1 "Notes - The Overclockers"
efrit-gnus: related footnote for "Recap Bot: ..." (treatment): 1 document(s)
```

A provider or source that fails is a `WARN` line with the reason, and
`W R` by hand says the same in the echo area: "no related documents for
\"overclockers\" (gcalendar: no auth-source entry for Calendar ...)".
The words line tells you what the title reduced to after stopwords; if
it is empty, nothing is searched.

## Failure messages

Errors are turned into one line naming what to fix:

- `the token lacks a scope (403): ...; add it to the auth-source entry and run M-x efrit-auth-reauthorize` — the scope is missing, or was added to the entry but not consented to yet.
- `access refused (403): ... API has not been used in project ...` — enable the API in the console (above).
- `access refused (403): ... admin_policy_enforced` — the Workspace admin gate (above).
- `no auth-source entry for Drive: tried hosts ...` — none of the candidate hosts has an entry with a Drive scope; add the scope or an entry named `gdrive`.
- `not found (404)` — a deleted document, or an id that is not a Google Doc.

`doc_sources` (or `M-x efrit-documents-list-sources`) shows each
source and, when a check command found it unusable, why.

## Writing another source

A source is a subclass of `efrit-document-source` with methods for
`efrit-documents-source-match` (URL → id or nil),
`efrit-documents-source-fetch` (id, format → document plist with
`:text`), optionally `efrit-documents-source-metadata` (cheap title and
`:modified`, for the cache) and `efrit-documents-source-search` (query
plist → document plists). Register with `efrit-documents-register`.
Talk to the API through `efrit-auth-request`; turn its errors into
`efrit-documents-error` with `efrit-auth-explain`. A *provider* of
related documents that is not itself a source (like Calendar) is a
function on `efrit-documents-related-functions` returning document
plists of some registered source. `efrit-documents-confluence.el` is
the shortest complete example of a source.
