;;; efrit-tool-registry.el --- Tools contributed by other packages -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; Version: 0.10.1
;; Package-Requires: ((emacs "28.1"))
;; Keywords: tools, convenience, ai

;;; Commentary:

;; efrit's built-in tools live in three tables: the schema sent to the
;; model (`efrit-do--tools-schema'), the dispatch table that maps a
;; tool name to its handler (`efrit-do--tool-dispatch-table'), and the
;; permission class of each tool (`efrit-permission-tool-classes').
;; All three are constants, so a package outside efrit had no way to
;; offer the model a tool of its own without patching efrit.
;;
;; This module is that way.  `efrit-register-tool' takes one
;; description of a tool -- its name, what the model should know
;; about it, its input schema, the function that runs it, and its
;; permission class -- and the three tables consult the registry:
;; the schema getter appends registered tools, the dispatcher falls
;; back to the registry for names it does not know, and the class
;; lookup does the same.  Registration is idempotent and can be
;; undone.
;;
;; A registered tool's function receives the tool input as an alist
;; with string keys (the JSON object the model sent, converted from
;; the hash table efrit uses internally) and returns a string, which
;; becomes the tool result.  Errors are caught and returned as an
;; error result, so a buggy tool cannot end the turn.
;;
;; Nothing here decides anything: the model chooses when to call a
;; tool, and consent stays with the sandbox (the tool function is
;; expected to call `efrit-sandbox-check' as efrit's own tools do,
;; with the capability the tool needs; a `read' tool that only reads
;; the package's own data needs none).

  "Offer the model a tool NAME implemented by FUNCTION.
DESCRIPTION is what the model reads to decide when to use it.
INPUT-SCHEMA is the JSON schema of the input as an alist in the shape
efrit uses for its own tools, for example

  \\='((\"type\" . \"object\")
    (\"properties\" . ((\"query\" . ((\"type\" . \"string\")

FUNCTION takes one argument, the input as an alist with string keys,
and returns a string.  CLASS is the permission class (`read' by
default; `write', `exec', `net' or `control'), which decides whether
external review looks at the call.  PACKAGE names the registering
package for `efrit-list-registered-tools'.

Registering a NAME again replaces the earlier registration.  A NAME
that collides with one of efrit's own tools is refused: those come
first in dispatch and the registration would never be reached."
