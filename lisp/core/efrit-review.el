;;; Commentary:

;; External verification, in the shape that pays for itself: the model
;; that does the work (the proposer) does not get to be the only judge
;; of whether the work matches what the user asked.  Before a turn's
;; mutating tool calls run, a second call (the reviewer) sees the
;; user's request, the proposer's own words from this turn, and the
;; exact tool calls with their inputs, and answers approve or reject
;; with a reason.  A rejection is fed back to the proposer as a failed
;; tool_result, in the same shape as a sandbox denial, and the turn
;; continues: the proposer revises or explains.
;;
;; What the reviewer does NOT see, on purpose: tool outputs and the
;; rest of the conversation.  Tool outputs are the prompt-injection
;; surface (a file the proposer read may carry text aimed at whoever
;; reads it next), and the reviewer's judgement is only worth having
;; if it is formed from the user's intent and the proposed actions
;; alone.  This also keeps the review request small (a few thousand
;; tokens), so the added cost per turn is a fraction of the main call.
;;
;; What the reviewer is NOT: consent.  The sandbox prompt remains the
;; human approval for scope; a reviewer's "approve" grants nothing.
;; And it is not a third party: with the default configuration it is
;; the same model family as the proposer, which catches slips and
;; misread intent, not shared misjudgement.  `efrit-review-model' can
;; point at a different model; independence is a configuration choice,
;; not something this file can manufacture.
;;
;; Only tool calls in the classes `efrit-review-classes' (default:
;; write and exec, per `efrit-permission-tool-classes') are reviewed.
;; A turn with none of them is not reviewed.  Reads and efrit's own
;; control tools never are.

;;; The review request

(defconst efrit-review--system-prompt
  "You review actions an AI coding agent proposes inside a user's Emacs, before they run.
You see: the user's standing instructions (their AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md files, when any),
the user's request, the agent's own words this turn, and the exact tool calls.
You do not see tool outputs or earlier turns. Judge only from what is shown.

The standing instructions are the user's own and apply to every turn: an action they
call for (keeping a work log, a clock file, a notes file, a checkpoint) is asked for
even when the request of the moment does not mention it.

Lines marked [FLAG kind: …] under a call are facts about what the Lisp it writes or
evaluates does, read statically: key = binds a key; hook / advice = changes what other
code runs; core-var = sets a variable that changes how Emacs behaves; vc = a use-package
:vc block (a remote repository, branch or revision the config will fetch and run); shadow =
defines a name that belongs to another library; load = loads code; effect = deletes,
writes, or starts a process; shell = starts another Emacs.  A flag is not a verdict: weigh
it against the request.  A change the user asked for that rebinds a key is fine; a :vc
block pointing at a new remote, a shadowed macro, or an advice on a core function that the
request did not call for is not, and a flagged batch-Emacs line needs the agent's stated
reason (in AGENT SAID THIS TURN).  Say which flag decided it.

Reject a batch when any call:
- does something the user did not ask for -- in the request or the standing instructions --
  or would plausibly object to (deleting, overwriting unrelated files, changing configuration,
  sending data out, running commands with effects beyond the task);
- contradicts the agent's own stated plan;
- is destructive with no evident reason;
- touches secrets, credentials, or another project.
Approve otherwise. Ordinary imperfection is not a reason to reject; the user reviews results.

A line [SANDBOX would ask: CAP TARGET | computed confidence S | facts] under a call means the
user's sandbox has no grant for it and would stop to ask them.  The facts are what efrit
knows: how often the user granted or denied this pattern before, whether the request names
the target, whether the shell line is read-only, whether the path is in a repository they
granted before.  You may vouch for the user: add \"confidence\": C (0..1), how sure you are
the user would say yes, and \"grant\": \"once\" or \"session\".  C may not exceed S; S already
counts the facts, you only lower it when the request itself gives reason (an odd target for
the task, a command whose output the task does not need).  At or above the user's threshold
your vouching replaces their keypress for this turn, so vouch only when you would bet on it.
A call with no SANDBOX line needs no confidence.

Answer with one JSON object and nothing else -- no prose before it, no code fence:
{\"verdict\": \"approve\"}, {\"verdict\": \"approve\", \"confidence\": 0.97, \"grant\": \"session\"},
or {\"verdict\": \"reject\", \"reason\": \"<one or two sentences, addressed to the agent, saying what to change>\"}"
