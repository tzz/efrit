;;; Commentary:

;; External verification, in the shape that pays for itself: the model
;; that does the work (the proposer) does not get to be the only judge
;; of whether the work matches what the user asked.  Before a turn's
;; mutating tool calls run, a second call (the reviewer) sees the
;; user's request, the proposer's own words from this turn, and the
;; exact tool calls with their inputs, and answers approve or reject
;; with a reason.  A rejection is fed back to the proposer as a failed
;; tool_result, in the same shape as a sandbox denial, and the turn
;; continues: the proposer revises or explains.
;;
;; What the reviewer does NOT see, on purpose: tool outputs and the
;; rest of the conversation.  Tool outputs are the prompt-injection
;; surface (a file the proposer read may carry text aimed at whoever
;; reads it next), and the reviewer's judgement is only worth having
;; if it is formed from the user's intent and the proposed actions
;; alone.  This also keeps the review request small (a few thousand
;; tokens), so the added cost per turn is a fraction of the main call.
;;
;; What the reviewer is NOT: consent.  The sandbox prompt remains the
;; human approval for scope; a reviewer's "approve" grants nothing.
;; And it is not a third party: with the default configuration it is
;; the same model family as the proposer, which catches slips and
;; misread intent, not shared misjudgement.  `efrit-review-model' can
;; point at a different model; independence is a configuration choice,
;; not something this file can manufacture.
;;
;; Only tool calls in the classes `efrit-review-classes' (default:
;; write and exec, per `efrit-permission-tool-classes') are reviewed.
;; A turn with none of them is not reviewed.  Reads and efrit's own
;; control tools never are.
