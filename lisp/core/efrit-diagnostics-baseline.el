;;; efrit-diagnostics-baseline.el --- New diagnostics after each edit, mechanically -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; Copyright (C) 2026 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

;; Author: Ted Zlatanov <tzz@lifelogs.com>
;; Version: 0.5.1
;; Package-Requires: ((emacs "29.1"))
;; Keywords: tools, ai

;;; Commentary:

;; "Done" for a code change should mean: no diagnostics that were not
;; there before.  ai-code-interface asks the model to keep a baseline
;; and compare; efrit owns its loop, so it does it itself.
;;
;; Before a write tool touches a file the first time in a turn, the
;; file's Flymake/Flycheck diagnostics are recorded.  After each write
;; the checker gets a moment to run, the diagnostics are read again,
;; and the ones not in the baseline are appended to the tool result:
;;
;;   [new diagnostics in greet.el: 12: error: void-variable nme]
;;
;; The model sees the damage in the same result that reported the
;; edit, and fixes it before saying it is done.  Per turn: the
;; baseline is dropped at the next turn's start
;; (`efrit-diagnostics-baseline-begin-turn').
