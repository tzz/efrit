;;; efrit-buffer-watch.el --- Has this buffer changed since the model read it? -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:

;; The model reads a buffer, thinks, and edits it by position.  If
;; the user typed in between, the positions are stale and the edit
;; lands in the wrong place.  This file remembers, per buffer, what
;; the model last saw, and tells an edit tool whether the buffer moved
;; since, and where.
;;
;; With `track-changes' (Emacs 30, or GNU ELPA) the report is exact:
;; the changed region and its old text, coalesced safely even for
;; edits made with hooks inhibited.  Without it, the fallback is
;; `buffer-chars-modified-tick': changed or not, no region.
;;
;; `efrit-buffer-watch-note-read' after a read; `efrit-buffer-watch-changes'
;; before an edit returns nil (unchanged) or a plist describing the
;; change; the edit tool puts it in its result so the model re-reads.
