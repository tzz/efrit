;;; Commentary:

;; Google Docs, Sheets and Slides (and files Drive can export as text)
;; for `efrit-documents'.  Setup is one auth-source entry named by
;; `efrit-documents-gdrive-auth-host' (default "gdrive"), or -- when
;; that is absent -- the first entry among `efrit-documents-gdrive-auth-hosts'
;; that carries a Drive scope, so the Gmail entry nngmail already uses
;; serves, with no second consent, once its :scope includes
;; https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly.
;;
;;   machine gdrive login you@example.com
;;     client-id ... client-secret ...
;;     auth-url https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth
;;     token-url https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token
;;     scope "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly"
;;     redirect-uri http://localhost:8999
;;
;; Fetch: the metadata call gives the title and modifiedTime (so an
;; unchanged doc is served from cache), then Drive's export endpoint
;; gives Markdown (for the model), HTML (for a renderer) or plain text.
;; Search: files.list with a q= built from the query's words and
;; dates, over documents the account can read.  Calendar's "take
;; meeting notes" docs are ordinary Docs in Drive named after the
;; meeting, so `efrit-documents-related' finds them by title and date
;; with no Calendar API.
;;
;; The Cloud project that owns the OAuth client must have the Google
;; Drive API enabled (console: APIs & Services > Library > Google Drive
;; API) and the scope added on its consent screen; then re-consent once
;; with `efrit-auth-reauthorize'.  docs/DOCUMENTS.md walks through it.
;;
;; The source registers itself when this file loads.  Whether it works
;; is decided at first use (credentials are looked up then); `M-x
;; efrit-documents-gdrive-check' tells you now.
