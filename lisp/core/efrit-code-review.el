;;; efrit-code-review.el --- Local code review of a change set, findings as patches -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; Copyright (C) 2026 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

;; Author: Ted Zlatanov <tzz@lifelogs.com>
;; Version: 0.11.0
;; Package-Requires: ((emacs "29.1"))
;; Keywords: tools, vc, ai

;;; Commentary:

;; A review of what is about to be committed (or pushed, or merged),
;; done locally, before a person sees it.  The model reads the diff of
;; a SCOPE (the staged changes, the commits not yet pushed, or the
;; branch against its base), may read files at the scope's revision
;; and search the tree, and ends with one `submit_review' call: a list
;; of FINDINGS.  A finding is a comment on a place, a suggestion with
;; an exact replacement, or an all-clear for a file.
;;
;; Suggestions arrive as SEARCH/REPLACE text (`old_lines'/`new_lines'),
;; never as a diff the model authored: models copy the text they read
;; far more reliably than they count lines (after magit-hutch, Akshay
;; Gupta, 2026-10-05; tzz, 2026-10-09: "study this article and see how
;; much of that we can use in efrit").  The GATES then check every
;; finding against the real tree: a file that does not exist drops
;; the finding; an `old_lines' that is missing or ambiguous turns the
;; suggestion into a comment; a unique match becomes a unified diff
;; through `efrit-vcs-diff-strings'.  So what the user queues and
;; applies is always a patch efrit made from the file it has.
;;
;; `efrit-code-review-run' is the driver: a side conversation like the
;; package review's, with tools, outside any agent session.  The
;; buffer that shows the findings and applies the queued ones is
;; `efrit-code-review-ui'.  A finished review is saved under the
;; scope's diff hash in `efrit-data-directory', so the same change set
;; opens again without another request.

  "You review a change set for its author, before anyone else sees it.  Find the substantive problems: bugs, logic errors, unhandled cases, races, security holes, broken contracts with callers.  Style is not a finding unless it hides a bug.

Look at the change from at least three angles before you submit (correctness, error handling, edge cases, security, concurrency, API contracts, tests).  Aim for two to five findings on a substantive change.  For a trivial change (documentation, formatting, renames, dependency bumps) submit {file, lgtm: true} per file; do not invent findings.

Round budget: at most %d tool rounds; by round %d prefer comments over more reading.  Once you have read a file or diff you have it; do not read it again.

Suggestion or comment: a small, certain fix (typo, wrong operator, off-by-one, swapped argument, missing guard) MUST be a suggestion with old_lines and new_lines.  A judgement call (cross-file impact, several possible fixes, unknown caller expectations) is a comment with lines.

old_lines rules: exact text copied from the file, every space and tab; unique in the file (add a line above or below until it is); three to ten lines usually.  Call verify_block before you rely on a block.  If it says NOT_FOUND or AMBIGUOUS, fix the block or make the finding a comment.

End with exactly one submit_review call.  Never answer in prose."
