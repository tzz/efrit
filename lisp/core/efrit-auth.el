;;; Commentary:

;; Document sources (Google Drive, Confluence, ...) need to talk to a
;; web API as the user.  This file gives them one way to do it that
;; starts and ends in auth-source:
;;
;;   (efrit-auth-request "drive" "GET" "https://www.googleapis.com/drive/v3/files"
;;                       :params '(("q" . "name contains 'recap'")))
;;
;; "drive" is an auth-source host.  The entry for it decides how to
;; authenticate:
;;
;;   - OAuth2 (Google, Atlassian cloud): the entry carries
;;     :client-id :client-secret :auth-url :token-url, plus :scope and
;;     optionally :redirect-uri :state :use-pkce.  The token comes from
;;     oauth2.el (`oauth2-auth-and-store', so the consent flow, the
;;     plstore and the refresh are the same as for Gnus's xoauth2
;;     plugin and nngmail; with oauth2-loopback loaded the code is
;;     caught on localhost).  The id of the stored token is computed
;;     from auth-url, token-url, scope, client-id and user, so an entry
;;     with a wider scope gets its own consent once and is then cached.
;;   - Bearer token / API token (Confluence with a personal access
;;     token, most self-hosted services): the entry has only :user and
;;     :secret (the password).  It is sent as "Authorization: Bearer".
;;     An entry with :auth-type "basic" sends HTTP Basic instead
;;     (Atlassian cloud API tokens want user:token in Basic).
;;
;; Lookups bypass auth-source's cache and the xoauth2 plugin's advice
;; (both bit nngmail: a negative cache and the plugin running its own
;; token dance while we only wanted the client id).
;;
;; `efrit-auth-request' returns the parsed JSON (or the raw body with
;; :raw t) and signals `efrit-auth-http-error' with (STATUS MESSAGE URL)
;; on 4xx/5xx after one token refresh on 401 and short retries on
;; transport errors and 5xx.  There is no quota policy here: sources
;; that need pacing (Gmail does) keep their own.
;;
;; `M-x efrit-auth-reauthorize HOST' drops the token held in memory and
;; runs the consent flow again -- for after the entry's scope changed.
;; `M-x efrit-auth-check HOST' says what the entry looks like and
;; whether a token can be obtained, without a request.
