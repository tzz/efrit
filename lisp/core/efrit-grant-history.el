;;; Commentary:

;; Session grants vanish with the Emacs; project grants are saved per
;; repository.  Neither tells the reviewer what the user has tended to
;; answer: "read under ~/ai_workspace/source/autodist, granted eleven
;; times, denied never" is the fact that makes a twelfth prompt
;; pointless (tzz, 2026-10-03: "derived from past interactions and from
;; some basic rules").
;;
;; This file keeps, per (CAP . PATTERN), the user's answers as dated
;; events.  A pattern is coarser than a grant target: a path is reduced
;; to its repository (or directory when outside any), a host to itself,
;; a shell line to its sorted command set.  The store is a JSON file in
;; `efrit-data-directory'.  Nothing here grants anything; see
;; `efrit-review-confidence' for how the record is weighed.
;;
;; Two things about an answer matter besides yes/no (tzz, 2026-10-03:
;; "add a decay factor for my approvals; a permanent grant is worth
;; more than a session which is more than a one-time grant"): its
;; SCOPE, weighted by `efrit-grant-history-scope-weights', and its AGE,
;; halved every `efrit-grant-history-half-life-days'.  A denial weighs
;; against, more than any single yes weighs for.  `efrit-grant-history-
;; strength' is the decayed, weighted sum the reviewer reads.
