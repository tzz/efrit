;;; Commentary:

;; 2026-10-04 20:02: the model's sixth request of a turn stalled; after
;; the watchdog the turn ended as "api-error" and the fourteen fetched
;; articles, the searches and the half-written answer were gone.  tzz:
;; "I'd like efrit to try to resolve the connectivity issue … check
;; periodically if the connection is back up, or ask the user if they
;; want to abort the work."
;;
;; A failed request is not a failed turn.  The messages that were about
;; to be sent are still in the session; sending them again costs
;; nothing but time.  So:
;;
;;   1. Classify the error.  Transport trouble (a stall, a timeout, DNS,
;;      connection refused or reset, 5xx, 429, 529) is retried.  Anything
;;      the server said about the request itself (400, 401, 403, a
;;      content-policy refusal) is not: sending it again gets the same
;;      answer.
;;   2. Retry the same request with a growing pause
;;      (`efrit-reconnect-backoff-seconds'), noting each try in the
;;      transcript.  Before each retry a cheap probe asks the endpoint
;;      whether it answers at all; while it does not, the pause is
;;      spent waiting rather than failing.
;;   3. After the budget (`efrit-reconnect-max-retries') the turn pauses
;;      on a question: keep waiting (probe every
;;      `efrit-reconnect-wait-poll-seconds', resume by itself), retry now,
;;      or abort.  No timeout answers it; unattended mode answers
;;      "keep waiting".
;;
;; Nothing here is streaming-specific: the loop's `api-call-fn' is
;; wrapped, and both transports report errors the same way.
