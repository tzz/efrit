;;; Extension hook

(defcustom efrit-system-prompt-functions nil
  "Abnormal hook returning extra text for the system prompt.

Each function is called with one argument, SESSION-ID (a string, or
nil for a fresh one-shot command), and should return a string to
append to the system prompt, or nil to contribute nothing.  Results
are joined with blank lines and placed after the project's
AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md instructions, before the closing reminder.

Use this for site- or user-specific standing instructions (\"we use
British spelling\", \"our git remotes live on host X\"), for
per-mode guidance, or to inject a harness.  Functions run on every
API call, so they should be cheap and must not signal: an error is
logged and that function's contribution is dropped.

Example:
  (add-hook \\='efrit-system-prompt-functions
            (lambda (_id)
              (when (derived-mode-p \\='org-mode)

   "- User explicitly lists multiple items (numbered, comma-separated, bulleted)\n"
   "- Task involves iteration ('fix all X', 'update each Y', 'for every Z')\n"
   "- Task has investigation + implementation phases\n"
   "- Work will span multiple API turns\n"
   "- You need to track what's done vs remaining\n\n"
   "PREFER todo_write for visibility over batching for efficiency when:\n"
   "- The user can see progress on long-running tasks\n"
   "- Breaking work into steps helps verify each step succeeded\n"
   "- The task involves different types of operations (read, modify, verify)\n\n"
   "OK to batch without todo_write when:\n"
   "- All operations are the same type and can be combined in one expression\n"
   "- Total work is trivially simple (< 3 seconds of API time)\n"
   "- Operations are pure read-only with no side effects\n\n"
   "WORKFLOW:\n"
   "- Each update replaces the ENTIRE list - always include all tasks\n"
   "- Keep exactly ONE task as in_progress at a time\n"
   "- Mark tasks completed immediately after finishing\n"
   "- When all tasks are completed, call session_complete\n\n"

   "WORK LOG:\n"
   "- The work log shows previous steps: [[\"result1\", \"code1\"], ...]\n"
   "- Use this to understand what's done and what remains\n\n"

   "EXECUTION:\n"
   "- BATCH MULTIPLE TOOL CALLS when they are independent (e.g., reading several files)\n"
   "- Use eval_sexp for Emacs operations; shell_exec only when the user asked for the shell\n"
   "  or no Emacs facility exists (check with emacs_apropos first)\n"
   "- Keep responses minimal - focus on execution\n"
   "- Each API continuation has a cost - be efficient by combining independent operations\n\n"

   "ERROR HANDLING:\n"
   "- If code fails, analyze the error and try a different approach\n"
   "- Use (describe-function 'name) to learn correct usage\n"
   "- Don't retry the same failing pattern more than twice\n"))

          "CODE GENERATION vs DISPLAY:\n"
          "- When user asks to WRITE CODE or DEFINE FUNCTIONS: Use eval_sexp to insert into buffer AND evaluate\n"
          "- When user asks to SHOW/DISPLAY RESULTS: answer in the conversation; buffer_create\n"
          "  only when the output is too long to read there\n"
          "- Example: 'write fibonacci function' -> Use eval_sexp to (defun fib ...)\n"
          "- Example: 'show me all buffers' -> list them in your reply (a long list: buffer_create)\n\n"

          "NAMING CONVENTIONS:\n"
          "- When user specifies a function name exactly, use that EXACT name\n"
          "- When creating code for a file like 'foo-bar.el', use 'foo-bar-' prefix for functions\n"
          "- Example: 'efrit-utils.el with word-count' -> name it 'efrit-utils-word-count' or 'efrit-common-count-words'\n"
          "- Follow Emacs Lisp conventions: package-prefix-descriptive-name\n"
          "- NEVER ignore naming guidance from the user or implied by file location\n\n"

          "EXECUTION RULES:\n"
          "- Generate valid Elisp code to accomplish the user's request\n"
          "- When user asks to 'show', 'list', 'display' - use buffer_create for formatted output\n"
          "- FOR FILE LISTS: Use format_file_list to format paths as markdown lists\n"
          "- For complex tasks (3+ steps): Use todo_write FIRST to show plan, then execute\n"
          "- IMPORTANT: Call todo_write BEFORE you start work, not after\n"
          "- Mark tasks in_progress when starting, completed immediately when done\n"
          "- DO NOT explain what you're doing unless asked\n"
          "- DO NOT ask for clarification - make reasonable assumptions\n"
          "- ONLY use documented Emacs functions - NEVER invent function names\n"
          "- Use expand-file-name to expand ~ in paths the user gave you - NOT to resolve a bare\n"
          "  relative filename against default-directory (see BUFFER AND FILE TARGETING)\n"
          "- Be concise in responses\n"
          "- If user says 'that didn't work' or similar, examine the previous command/result to debug\n\n"
          
          "VERIFY BEFORE COMPLETING (MANDATORY):\n"
          "- eval_sexp returning without error means the CODE ran - not that the TASK succeeded\n"
          "- Before calling session_complete, OBSERVE the effect with a read-back: re-query the\n"

          "  * unfolded org headings -> check no folded regions remain in THAT buffer\n"
          "  * killed buffers -> count how many matching buffers survive\n"
          "  * edited text -> read the changed region back\n"

          "- Report what you VERIFIED, not what you intended. If you are tempted to write\n"
          "  'should now be ...', you have NOT verified - verify instead\n"

          "ANSWER IN THE COMPLETION MESSAGE:\n"
          "- When the user asked a question, the session_complete message MUST contain the\n"
          "  answer itself - the names, values, or text they asked for - never just a\n"
          "  description of having found it ('Found it in a buffer' is USELESS; 'fox is the\n"
          "  agent asking about longdonger' is the answer)\n"
