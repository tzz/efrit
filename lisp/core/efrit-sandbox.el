;;; Commentary:

;; efrit may not read, write, or execute anything the user has not
;; granted.  Grants are *scopes*, decided per project:
;;
;;   read   PREFIX   read files/dirs under PREFIX (search, vcs, read_file)
;;   write  PREFIX   create/edit/delete files under PREFIX, save buffers
;;   exec   elisp    evaluate Lisp (eval_sexp)
;;   exec   shell    run shell commands (one grant; see below)
;;   exec   net      fetch URLs / web search
;;   buffer TARGET   touch a live buffer (read or edit its text)
;;
;; A PREFIX is a directory (or file) path.  It includes the Tramp
;; remote identity, so /ssh:host:/proj is a different scope from
;; /proj.  The project root gets `read' by default and nothing else.
;;
;; The `buffer' capability closes a hole the file checks cannot see: a
;; live buffer already visiting a file outside the project exposes that
;; file's contents through buffer operations (buffer-string, insert,
;; save) that resolve no file name, so the file-name handler never
;; fires.  Reading or editing such a buffer needs a `buffer' grant.
;; The buffer the user works in, efrit's own UI buffers, and buffers
;; visiting a file inside the project are allowed without asking (see
;; `efrit-sandbox-buffer-allowed-p').  A grant's TARGET is the visited
;; file's path when the buffer has one, else the cons (buffer . NAME).
;;
;; When a tool needs more than the current scope allows, it does not
;; run.  `efrit-sandbox-check' signals `efrit-sandbox-denied' carrying
;; a *request* -- the minimal grant that would have let it proceed.
;; The UI (efrit-sandbox-ui) turns that into a prompt offering the
;; grant once / for this session / for this project.  Project grants
;; are persisted as JSON in .efrit/sandbox.json (efrit-sandbox-store);
;; `.efrit/' itself is a hard write deny for every path, including
;; eval_sexp.
;;
;; A shell grant names commands (git, make, ...), not a blanket
;; permission; see "Shell commands" below.  That is a boundary
;; against accidents, not against a hostile model: any command can
;; escalate to any other.  Most of what an agent wants from a shell is
;; available through Emacs primitives, which *are* checked.
;;
;; Pure Executor: this is security filtering, which ARCHITECTURE.md
;; allows.  No task logic lives here.
