;;; Commentary:

;; One public hook instead of advice.  `efrit-agent-integration.el'
;; wires the agent buffer to the loop with nine `advice-add's on
;; progress and session functions, the REPL adapter passes no
;; `event-fn' at all, and `efrit-event.el' (singular) is only a
;; formatter for the progress buffer.  Anyone wanting a desktop
;; notification when a turn finishes, or a mode-line token count, has
;; nowhere to hook in.
;;
;; This module is deliberately tiny (after agent-shell's
;; `agent-shell-subscribe-to'):
;;
;;   (efrit-subscribe 'turn-complete
;;                    (lambda (ev) (notify (alist-get :session-id ev))))
;;   (efrit-publish 'turn-complete `((:session-id . ,id) (:stop-reason . ,r)))
;;
;; Every subscriber runs inside `condition-case': a broken subscriber
;; is logged and cannot take the loop down.  Subscribing to `t' gets
;; every event.

;;                     the next tool results (`efrit-repl-loop--steer')
;;   steered           :text -- the text was delivered to the model

;;   prompt-answered-unattended :label :answer :why -- unattended mode answered it
;;   queued            :text :count -- an input waits for the turn to end
;;   turn-complete     :stop-reason :completion-message
;;   idle              :idle-event (the event that started the idle
;;                     timer, e.g. turn-complete) -- fires after
;;                     `efrit-idle-delay' seconds with no new activity,
;;                     the hook for "ping me when it's done and I've
