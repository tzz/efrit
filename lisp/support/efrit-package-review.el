;;; Commentary:

;; Emacs 31 can stop before installing a package and let you read the
;; source, diff it against the previous installation, and read the
;; change log (`package-review-policy', `package-review').  Reading a
;; whole package before every upgrade is more than most people do,
;; which is what makes the review a formality.  This module has a
;; model read it and report, so the human decision is made with the
;; risky forms already pointed at.
;;
;; `efrit-package-review-mode' wraps `package-review'.  Before
;; package.el asks "Install?", the reviewer sees the same material the
;; user could open (the sources, the diff when there was a previous
;; install, the changelog) and returns a verdict with findings: each
;; a severity, a file and line, and one sentence.  The report opens in
;; a popup beside the prompt (q closes it), and the prompt itself is
;; prefixed with the verdict.  What happens next is
;; `efrit-package-review-action':
;;
;;   annotate            show the report; you answer the prompt (default)
;;   auto-approve-clean  a clean verdict answers yes for you; anything
;;                       flagged, or a failed review, falls back to
;;                       the prompt with the report shown
;;
;; `M-x efrit-review-package' runs the same review on demand for an
;; installed or an archive package, on any Emacs version.
;;
;; The reviewer starts from the diff and the change log (or the file
;; list, for a new install) and opens files itself with one tool,
;; read_package_file, confined to the package directory.  A whole
;; package sent up front was refused by the API; this is also how a
;; person reads an upgrade.  The report lists what was opened.  The
;; rubric: network use, evaluation or loading of foreign code, writes
;; outside the package directory, external programs, redefinition of
;; built-ins, encoded data, credentials, and diff-level changes of
;; maintainer, archive, dependencies or load-time code.
;;
;; The model is `efrit-package-review-model' when set, else the
;; per-turn reviewer's model, else the default: a rarer and higher
;; stakes review is where a stronger model earns its cost.
;;
;; Nothing here runs package code.  The reads are efrit's own, made
;; on the user's request, so they are not sandbox prompts (the sandbox
;; gates what the model does); the API call carries a purpose so a
;; failure names it.  None of this is reachable from eval_sexp: the
;; efrit-package-review prefix is on the refused list.

(defconst efrit-package-review--system-prompt
  "You are helping an Emacs user decide whether to install or upgrade an Emacs Lisp package from a public package archive.  This is an ordinary pre-install code review of open-source software, the same reading a careful maintainer does before pressing yes.

You are given the package's metadata, its change log, and either a unified diff from the version already installed or, for a new install, the list of files.  You have one tool, read_package_file, to open any file of the package by name, whole or by line range.  Start from the diff: open the files it touches where the diff alone does not show what the new code does.  For a new install, open the main file and anything whose name or size stands out.  Do not read every file; read what the decision needs.

Report, briefly and specifically, what the user should look at before installing.  In order of importance:
1. Network use, and what is done with anything received.
2. Evaluation or loading of code that is not part of the package's own files.
3. Files written or modified outside the package's own directory (user init files, dotfiles, system paths).
4. External programs run, and which.
5. Redefinition of, or advice on, built-in Emacs functions.
6. Encoded or hard-to-read data in the source, and what it is for.
7. Configuration or credentials read, and where they are sent.
8. In the diff: changes of maintainer, archive or repository URL; new dependencies; new code that runs at load time.

Behaviour that is the package's stated purpose is not a finding; mention it once as info.

When you have read enough, answer with exactly one JSON object and nothing else:
{\"verdict\": \"approve\" | \"reject\",
 \"summary\": one or two sentences for the user,
 \"findings\": [{\"severity\": \"high\"|\"medium\"|\"low\"|\"info\", \"file\": \"relative/path.el\", \"line\": N or null, \"note\": one sentence}],
 \"files_read\": [\"relative/path.el\", ...],
 \"saw_everything\": true | false}
Use reject when a high finding exists, or a medium one is not explained by the package's purpose.  Set saw_everything false if you could not open something you needed."
  "System prompt for the package reviewer.
Diff first, sources on request.  A whole package sent up front (57k
tokens of code beside a review rubric) was refused by the API before
generation; the small first request and the reviewer's own reads keep
each request modest and match how an upgrade is read by a person.")
