;;; efrit-reload.el --- Reload every loaded efrit library from source -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; Author: Ted Zlatanov <tzz@lifelogs.com>
;; Version: 0.4.1
;; Package-Requires: ((emacs "28.1"))

;;; Commentary:

;; `M-x efrit-reload' re-`load's every efrit feature that is currently
;; loaded, in the order they were first loaded (dependencies before
;; dependents), so a checkout edited in place takes effect without
;; restarting Emacs.
;;
;; What it keeps: your customizations.  `defvar'/`defcustom' do not
;; reassign a bound variable, so settings and buffer-local state
;; survive; `defconst' and `defface' do get their new values.
;; Timers, hooks and advice added with `add-hook'/`advice-add' are
;; idempotent and stay in place.
;;
;; Keymaps are the exception that bit: `(defvar foo-map (let ((map
;; ...)) ...))' is skipped on reload, so a new key binding in the
;; source never reaches the live map.  `efrit-reload' therefore
;; unbinds every `efrit-*-map' variable first, so the defvar runs
;; again and the mode picks up the fresh map.  Minor-mode maps
;; registered in `minor-mode-map-alist' by symbol follow along;
;; `define-derived-mode' maps are re-looked-up per buffer.
;;
;; What it cannot do: a struct whose slots changed keeps existing
;; instances in the old shape until they are recreated (an agent
;; buffer's session, for one), and an `eval-after-load' body runs
;; again.  When something looks stale after a reload, kill the agent
;; buffer and start it fresh; when things look wrong, restart Emacs.
;;
;; The source file is preferred over a stale .elc: `load' with the
;; extension elided picks the newer of the two, as `load-prefer-newer'
;; would, so an edited .el wins over the .elc compiled before it.
