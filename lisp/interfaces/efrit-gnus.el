;;; efrit-gnus.el --- Ask efrit about mail and news in Gnus -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; Copyright (C) 2026 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

;; Author: Ted Zlatanov <tzz@lifelogs.com>
;; Version: 0.4.1
;; Package-Requires: ((emacs "29.1"))
;; Keywords: tools, convenience, ai, mail, gnus

;;; Commentary:

;; Gnus shows the mail; efrit reads it for you.  This file does two
;; things, for any Gnus backend (nnimap, nnml, nntp, nngmail...):
;;
;; 1. Commands that hand efrit a set of articles and a question.  In a
;;    summary buffer, `efrit-gnus-analyze' takes the articles you mean
;;    (the active region's lines, else the process-marked ones, else
;;    the one at point), a prompt chosen by name from
;;    `efrit-gnus-prompts' or typed, and starts an efrit turn with the
;;    articles inlined as text.  `efrit-gnus-analyze-thread' takes the
;;    thread at point, `efrit-gnus-analyze-unread' every unread article
;;    of a group, `efrit-gnus-analyze-group' the newest N of a group,
;;    and `efrit-gnus-analyze-search' the results of a Gnus search
;;    (`gnus-search', so the query syntax is your server's).  The turn
;;    shows in the efrit buffer as one line ("analyze 12 articles from
;;    unread in INBOX: triage"); the model receives the prompt and the
;;    text.
;;
;; 2. Tools the model can call on its own in any turn, registered with
;;    `efrit-register-tool': `gnus_groups' (subscribed groups with
;;    unread counts), `gnus_search' (a `gnus-search' query on a
;;    server; returns a listing with article references), and
;;    `gnus_articles' (full text of articles by reference).  With these
;;    efrit can follow an analysis up -- "find her reply", "what else
;;    came from that list this week" -- without leaving the
;;    conversation.  They are read-only.  Nothing here marks, moves or
;;    edits an article.
;;
;; An article reference is GROUP#NUMBER, the full Gnus group name and
;; the article number in it; that is what the listings show and what
;; `gnus_articles' takes.
;;
;; Articles are rendered through Gnus's own fetch (`gnus-request-article')
;; and MIME layer: headers, the text/plain part, else text/html through
;; shr, attachment names and sizes.  Each article is capped at
;; `efrit-gnus-article-max-chars' and the whole payload at
;; `efrit-gnus-max-chars'; what does not fit is listed by header with a
;; note, so the model knows what it did not read.
;;
;; Reading an article in Gnus marks it read.  These commands do not go
;; through the summary's article display, so they leave marks alone.
;;
;; Links: a backend that can fetch a linked document (a Google Doc a
;; meeting recap points to, say) adds a function to
;; `efrit-gnus-expand-link-functions'; the document's text then follows
;; the article in everything the model sees, with no extra command.
;;
;; Privacy: article text goes to the model efrit is configured for, as
;; anything you ask efrit does.  The first analysis in an Emacs session
;; says how many articles and characters it is about to send and asks;
;; see `efrit-gnus-confirm'.
;;
;; Keys: `efrit-gnus-map' is bound under `efrit-gnus-summary-prefix-key'
;; (default `C-c g') in every Gnus summary and group buffer, and the analyze
;; commands are on the Gnus summary menu.  Backends may bind the map
;; elsewhere too (nngmail puts it under its `L A').
