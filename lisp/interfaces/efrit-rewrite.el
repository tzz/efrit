;;; efrit-rewrite.el --- Rewrite the region with the model, in place -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; Version: 0.5.1
;; Package-Requires: ((emacs "29.1"))
;; Keywords: tools, ai, convenience

;;; Commentary:

;; `efrit-rewrite-region': select text in any buffer, say what you
;; want done to it, and the model's rewrite comes back as a diff you
;; accept or refuse.  A side request (`efrit-ask-once'); the agent
;; buffer is not involved.
;;
;; The request uses an editable-region protocol (after minuet's duet,
;; 2026-09-28): the region is sent between markers with some context
;; either side, and the model must return exactly one region between
;; the same markers.  That is verifiable: a reply without exactly one
;; region is rejected instead of pasted.  Text the model echoes from
;; the surrounding context is trimmed off.
;;
;; The target is tracked by markers and by `buffer-chars-modified-tick':
;; if the buffer changed while the model worked, or while you looked
;; at the diff (timers and process filters keep running under
;; `y-or-n-p'), nothing is replaced and you are told.  The replacement
;; itself is `replace-region-contents', so markers and point survive.
;; A read-only target gets the rewrite on the kill ring instead.
