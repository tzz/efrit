;;; Commentary:

;; A rewrite preview drawn where the text is, not in a diff buffer:
;; lines that go away get the `diff-removed' face, lines that arrive
;; are shown after them in `diff-added'.  Nothing in the buffer
;; changes; overlays only.  `efrit-inline-diff-show' draws,
;; `efrit-inline-diff-clear' removes.
;;
;; The hunks come from Emacs's diff library, through
;; `efrit-vcs-diff-strings' (`diff-no-select'): no diff algorithm
;; lives here (the reuse rule, 2026-09-28).  `efrit-inline-diff-hunks'
;; parses the unified output into line ranges.
;;
;; Inserted lines that follow a replaced line are appended to the
;; *same* overlay's `after-string'.  Separate overlays sharing an
;; anchor render in an order Emacs does not promise (minuet-duet
;; found this on indented blank lines).
