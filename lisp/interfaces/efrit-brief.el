;; What goes out with a turn, shaped (after ai-code-interface,
;; 2026-09-28):
;;
;; - `efrit-brief': a prompt made of labelled sections (Goal, Scope,
;;   Context, Boundaries, Agent responsibilities, Verification
;;   evidence, Instruction); blank sections drop out.  The `question'
;;   kind says "answer only, no changes" and, through
;;   `efrit-brief-question-turn', makes the sandbox deny writes, shell
;;   and eval for that one turn: the boundary is enforced, not asked.
;;
;; - `efrit-prompt-suffix-functions': an abnormal hook over every
;;   outgoing input.  Each function gets an `efrit-prompt-context'
;;   (the text, the command that produced it, the buffer, a memo
;;   table shared by all providers of one send) and returns a string
;;   to append, or nil.  A provider that signals aborts the send.
;;
;; - `efrit-verbatim': a text property.  Text carrying it (a pasted
;;   diff, a quoted error) is left alone by mention expansion and by
;;   the suffix providers' view of the text; it is data, not
;;   instructions.  `efrit-mark-verbatim' sets it on a region.
;;
;; - `efrit-grill-me': the standing "ask first" instruction for the
;;   next send.
