;; Version: 0.4.1

;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This tool provides Claude with the ability to make surgical edits to files
;; using find-and-replace. This is the PRIMARY tool for file editing.
;;
;; Key features:
;; - Exact string matching (old_str must match exactly)
;; - Uniqueness check (old_str must be unique unless replace_all=true)
;; - Git-style diff output showing changes
;; - Automatic file saving
;; - Sandbox enforcement (paths must stay within project root)

;;; Code:

(require 'efrit-tool-utils)
(require 'cl-lib)
(require 'diff)
(require 'efrit-tool-undo-edit)

;;; Customization

(defcustom efrit-tool-edit-file-backup t
  "When non-nil, create backup before editing files."

(defcustom efrit-tool-edit-file-max-size 1000000
  "Maximum file size in bytes for editing (default: 1MB)."

ARGS is an alist with:

Returns a standard tool response with diff showing changes."
