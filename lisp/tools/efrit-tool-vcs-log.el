  "Get commit history.

ARGS is an alist with:
  path   - file or directory to filter by (default: whole repository)
  count  - number of commits (default: 10)
  since  - only commits at or after this date
  author - only commits whose author name or email contains this
  grep   - only commits whose subject contains this

Through VC (`efrit-vcs-log'); the filters are applied here, so more
entries than COUNT are read when filtering.  Returns a standard tool
response with a `commits' vector."
