;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Tool for showing proposed changes to the user before applying them.
;;
;; This enables a human-in-the-loop workflow where Claude can propose
;; changes and the user reviews them in a diff view before approval.
;;
;; Features:
;; - Unified diff display with diff-mode highlighting
;; - Support for new files, deletions, and modifications
;; - All-or-nothing or selective approval modes
;; - User can edit proposed changes before applying
