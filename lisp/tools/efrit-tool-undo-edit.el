;;; efrit-tool-undo-edit.el --- Per-file undo editing tool -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; Keywords: ai, tools, undo
;; Version: 0.4.1

;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This tool provides Claude with the ability to undo individual file edits.
;;
;; Key features:
;; - Per-file undo tracking (not session-level like checkpoint)
;; - Reverts most recent edit to a specific file
;; - Stores original content automatically when files are edited
;; - Complementary to checkpoint/restore (which works at session level)
;;
;; Usage pattern:
;; 1. Edit file with edit_file
;; 2. Run tests
;; 3. If tests fail, call undo_edit to revert just that file
;; 4. Try a different approach
