;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This tool provides Claude with the ability to atomically create files
;; with content.  This is the PRIMARY tool for creating new files.
;;
;; Key features:
;; - Atomic file creation (directory + file in one operation)
;; - Automatic parent directory creation
;; - Overwrite protection (requires explicit flag)
;; - Sandbox enforcement (paths must stay within project root)
;; - Git-style diff output for new files

;;; Code:

(require 'efrit-tool-utils)
(require 'efrit-file-io)
(require 'efrit-common)
(require 'cl-lib)
(require 'efrit-tool-undo-edit)

;;; Customization

  "Maximum content size in bytes for file creation (default: 1MB)."
