;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This tool provides Claude with the ability to read and analyze image files.
;; Images are returned as base64-encoded content blocks that Claude can
;; process visually.
;;
;; Supported formats:
;; - PNG (image/png)
;; - JPEG (image/jpeg)
;; - GIF (image/gif)
;; - WebP (image/webp)
;;
;; Size limits:
;; - Maximum 5MB per image (Claude API recommendation)
;; - Warning at 1MB

;;; Code:

(require 'efrit-tool-utils)
(require 'cl-lib)

;;; Customization

;;; Main Implementation

(defun efrit-tool-read-image (args)
  "Read an image file and return it for visual analysis by Claude.

ARGS is an alist with:
  path - path to the image file (required)

Returns either:
- A standard tool error response if the file can't be read
- A special image response that will be converted to an image content block

The image is returned as base64-encoded data with the appropriate MIME type.

Note: This tool bypasses the project sandbox since image viewing is read-only
and users commonly need to view images from anywhere (Desktop, Downloads, etc.)."
