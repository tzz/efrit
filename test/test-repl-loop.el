;;; test-repl-loop.el --- Tests for efrit-repl-loop -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:
;; Mocked tests for the REPL agentic loop over the shared engine
;; (efrit-loop, ef-0t4).  The API call and tool dispatch are stubbed,
;; so these run without network access and verify the wiring: turn
;; lifecycle, message accumulation, waiting-for-user pause, and the
;; API error path.
